            <h2 className="text-2xl font-normal text-blue-900 text-justify">Switzerland Study Visa Requirements</h2>
            <p className="text-lg">
                If you’re from a country outside the EU or EFTA (like India, Nigeria, or the USA), you must apply for a
                <strong> Switzerland student visa </strong>to pursue any academic program longer than 90 days. While students from EU/EFTA countries do not need a visa, they must
                register with local authorities after arrival and apply for a residence permit.
            </p>
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-normal text-blue-900 text-justify">Switzerland Student Visa Process</h2>
            <p className="text-lg">
                Obtaining an official letter of acceptance from a recognized Swiss institution is the first step in the <strong>Swiss student visa
                    application </strong>procedure. This is required for any stay longer than ninety days. After that, prospective students need to choose the right visa category.
                For short courses lasting up to 90 days, use the Schengen Visa (Type C), and use the National D visa for longer studies lasting more than three months.
                Candidates should submit their applications by making appointments and submitting their supporting papers at authorized Visa Application Centers such as
                VFS Global or the Swiss Embassy or Consulate. Before the visa sticker is provided, applications are reviewed and approved by cantonal migration officials,
                which usually takes 8 to 12 weeks. To obtain their official residence, non-EU/EFTA students must register with their local cantonal migration office within 14 days of arrival.
